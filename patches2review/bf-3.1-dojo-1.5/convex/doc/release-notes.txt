Convex 0.9.8+
-------------
This is a first preview of Convex for IE. It's an applet integration of the betterForm
core and allows offline use of XForms inside of IE 6. While the same code would work
in Firefox/Mozilla too (with some small patches to the javascript code) these show
an ugly initialization delay of 10 to 15 seconds when the liveconnect bridge is first accessed.
This is why we currently focus to make it work for IE first and later examine this problem
further.

Convex uses the latest code from betterForm CVS (0.9.8 with latest patches).

Warning: this is just a preview release and this not ready for production yet. There are
still some things missing and it's mainly meant to gather some feedback.
