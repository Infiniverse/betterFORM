Howto prepare your XForms for Convex
------------------------------------
To run your XForms with Convex you'll have to prepare them:

1. you'll need to include the following tags in the head section of your form:
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/convex.css"></link>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="script/convex.js"></script>
2. the XForms model must be embedded in
        <script type="text/xml">
          your model here
        </script>
   to keep the browser from interpreting this section
3. the body section must use a special div where the XForms UI will be integrated after Convex has transformed it
   into browser consumable markup. This looks like this:
   	<body>
        <div id="xformsui" class="disabled">
        ...your XForms UI here...
        </div>
4. finally you have to include the applet tag at the end of the document. For the correct markup please refer to
   the sample files coming with this preview.

This sounds like a lot of stuff but it should be easy to do all this with a XSLT transformation which is not yet
included with this preview.
