Installing Convex
-----------------
System requirements:
Convex has been build and tested with JDK 1.5 and you should have the java plugin installed on your system before
running Convex. Further you need a current version of Ant to build it.

To allow reading and writing of files to your local hard-disk Convex needs special permissions to break out
of the sandbox. Currently we're fairly generous by giving the applet all permissions. This is surely not the
final solution and should be considered an interims solution until we've worked out the right permission set.

To install Convex you've to execute the install.bat file from directory 'etc'. This will copy a .java.security
file to your home directory which grants all permissions to Convex.

After that you should execute the 'dist' target in the root-directory of Convex. This will create a folder
'dist' with sub-directory 'convex-0.9.8'. Inside you find sample forms that can be executed directly by
opening them in IE6.

Have fun.
