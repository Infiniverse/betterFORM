Known Issues
-----------------

1. The submission replace mode 'all' does not work currently with Convex.

The reason for this is that the applet actually does the submission and also gets the server response. In case of
a replace="all" this could be any kind of document on an arbitrary mimetype. The problem for the applet is to put
back this response into the browser and still show the right location. Normally the applet (unless it's signed)
the applet only has restricted access to its browser it's contained in.

While there might be ways to pass the response content to the browser somehow we currently do not see a solution
for maintaining the right Url (from where the response originated) in the locationbar of the browser.

Workaround:
Do not use submission replace="all" ;)

Instead always a submission replace="none" and a following 'load' action will do the same job for your form. E.g.

<xf:trigger>
  <xf:label>submit</xf:label>
  <xf:action>
    <xf:send submission="non-replacing-submission"/>
    <xf:load resource="new-Url-to-show" />
  </xf:action>
</xf:trigger>
