This directory contains the source files for the betterFORM reference forms. These are generated with XSLT
from the files in subdir 'xml'. The transformation results will be written to src/main/xforms/reference and
can be checked in there when updated.

NOTE: THE REFERENCE FORM GENERATION IS NOT INTEGRATED WITH THE BUILD PROCESS AND MUST BE TRIGGERED MANUALLY
WHENEVER CHANGES TO THE REFERENCE FORMS OCCUR. THIS IS TO KEEP THE BUILD PROCESS LEAN.
