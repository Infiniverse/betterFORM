                the x-model element is an empty element. @src will get resolved on demand by default.

                One might be tempted to inline the xforms model within the x-model but we actually do NOT want the
                model to be exposed under production circumstances. It should stays safely on the server.

                (However from a developers point of view it could make a lot of sense to inline the XForms model
                markup as shadow DOM.)
