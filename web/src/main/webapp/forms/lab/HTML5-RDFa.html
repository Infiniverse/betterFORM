        Example using data attributes for binding to XForms.

        Caveats:
        when attaching to a HTML input there's no way of adding children to this element as it is defined as empty.
        This means we cannot add actions as children in this scenario. These MUST be defined/placed elsewhere. Possible
        solutions will be dealts with in another example file in this directory.

        <div id="xforms">
            <div id="registration" class="InlineRoundBordersAlert">
                <!-- to load an external model -->
                <span id="myModel" data-xf-model="../forms/demo/registration.xhtml#m-registration"></span>

                <div id="signin">
                    Already a member? Sign in here
                </div>

                <form>
                    <div class="verticalTable">
                        <!-- label also does not seem to make much sense here as any arbitrary element can be used here (div, span, ...) -->
                        <label for="firstname1">First Name:</label>

                        Should we use 'data-xf-ref' or just plain 'data-xf-bind' which means to bind to a
                        XForms bind element by idref or both?.

                        Advantages of bind:
                        - just plain idrefs - complicated xpathes would be in the model not cluttering the content markup

                        Disadvantages of bind:
                        - requires to write a bind element in the model to link a control or add extra support for 'implied' binds
                        taking the value as node name.

                        additional attributes have their own data-xf-[attributename] equivalent:
