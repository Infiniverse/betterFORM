Hinte relating to creation and updating of betterForm Documentation
--------------------------------------------------------------

betterForm docs are maintained in OpenOffice format. There are the following main documents now:
- betterFormUserGuide.odt
- betterFormDeveloperGuide.odt
- CSSReference.odt

There's a OpenOffice template 'betterform-doc-template.ott' that can be applied or used when new documents were created.

If the format templates in the template file need updating you may be required to create a document based upon the template,
make your modification to styles and then restore as 'betterform-doc-template.ott'.

Currently the 'save-as'/Neoffice / html option in NeoOffice is used for exporting to html.
