                <p>We believe that technology should help people in their everyday life and make it easier. The
                    applications we created for our customers in the eHealth &amp; eGovernment sections are steps into
                    this
                    direction</p>

                <p>Our consequent orientation on open technologies and open industry standards guarantees the longevity
                    and
                    flexibility of our solutions. We always work closely with our customers to find the best solution
                    and to
                    provide functional software as early as possible. Attractive and convenient user interfaces increase
                    the
                    acceptance and efficient utilization of our applications.</p>

                <p>We don't think that there is only one technology to build everything. We are convinced that each
                    individual problem needs an appropriate solution.
                    We utilize various programming languages and technologies like Java
                    / J2EE, XML, XSLT, XPath, XQuery, (X)HTML, JavaScript, CSS and Objective-C.</p>
