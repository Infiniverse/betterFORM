                    <p>betterFORM eForms provides a generic standardized XForms based solution to
                    create dynamic forms for any kind of user input within Web-Applications. No custom scripting is needed to
                    validate user inputs, calculate data or to create fancy Web 2.0 ui controls. Thanks to strong
                    typing controls are rendered depending on how they are typed (e.q. data typed as boolean is rendered as a checkbox)
