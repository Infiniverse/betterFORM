This is the root directory for Java (.java) files. Java classes that are put here will be compiled with the
core betterFORM Java files.

You may add classes and packages here or overwrite an original betterFORM class e.g.:
a file 'Model.java' in package 'de.betterform.xml.xforms.model' will overwrite the original
betterFORM class when compiled.
