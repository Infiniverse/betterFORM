How to sign the Convex Applet
-----------------------------------
1. create a Certificate:
Certificates are build with the Java keytool which comes with the JDK. To create a new Certificate execute the
following command on the commandline:
>keytool -genkey -alias [cert-name]

[cert-name] has to be substituted with the name you want to use as reference to your newly created certificate.

If no keystore exists on your system already it will be created by the above command. When creating a new keystore
you'll be asked for a keystore password. When creating the actual certificate with the above command you'll also be
asked for a password for the certificate you're creating.

Attention: you should simply hit enter without typing a password
which will give the certificate the same password as the keystore password.

2. adapt the signjar.properties file
The signjar.properties file is found in the rootdirectory of the Convex source. It contains two properties which
have to be adapted prior to the actual signing process. These are:
- signjar.alias: this the alias under which the certificate has been created in your keystore
- signjar.storepass: here you have to put the password of your keystore.

3. sign the jars
call the ant task from Convex build.xml to sign all jarfiles:
>ant sign-jars

This will sign all jarfiles in deploy directory with the
